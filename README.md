# Solana Prediction Market Smart Contract

A decentralized prediction market built with Anchor framework for Solana Hackaroo.

## Features

- âœ… **Create Market**: Anyone can create a prediction market with a description and end time
- âœ… **Place Bet**: Users can bet YES or NO on market outcomes using SPL tokens
- âœ… **Resolve Market**: Market creators can resolve markets after the end time
- âœ… **Claim Winnings**: Winners can claim their proportional share of the total pool

## Smart Contract Functions

2. **`placeBet()`** - Places a bet on YES or NO outcome  
3. **`resolveMarket()`** - Resolves the market with winning outcome
4. **`claimWinnings()`** - Allows winners to claim their rewards
